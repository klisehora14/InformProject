You&apos;ve planned a wonderful camping trip with your girlfriend. She&apos;s depending on you to make the experience memorable, but everything keeps going wrong for you.

Project
The Campfire by Kapri Lisehora
Release 1 / Serial number 130227 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Campfire
It&apos;s night, but the fire just burned out and you both are getting cold. Your tent is in a grassy clearing. To the north are the woods, to the east a stream, and the west a rocky cliff. A mysterious cabin is to your south. In your tent there&apos;s a cooler, a backpack, and two sleeping bags.

You can see a cooler (closed), a backpack (closed) and sleeping bags here.

Fifth Trail
You turn west and stumble into a clearing. There&apos;s a small pond and nibbling at the grass around it is a glistening silver unicorn. You move towards the unicorn. She spies you, and whips her head up in alert. You halt instantly, not wanting to scare her away. &quot;Hey, pretty girl,&quot; you say, and reach for a carrot. She watches you intently. You hold the carrot out. &quot;Hey girl, do you want a treat?&quot; She paws at the ground. You take another step forward. Then another. And another. Finally, your outstretched arm holding the carrot is just infront of her head. She reaches forward, and takes the carrot. You give her another.

You can see Unicorn here.

You survived the camping trip! However, your girlfriend isn&apos;t very happy with you. You promised her a wonderful weekend, but there was literally nothing wonderful about it. You fed her sketchy soup that you stole from a cabin that you broke into, for heaven&apos;s sake!
But that was last weekend. It&apos;s Saturday morning, and you&apos;re in the Marketplace. You want to make it up to your girl, but you&apos;re not quite sure how. I guess the first thing would be to stop calling her &quot;girl&quot; or &quot;girlfriend&quot;. She has a name. It&apos;s Elily. Now, look around. Maybe you&apos;ll see something to inspire you.

Hayden takes a bite. &quot;Delicious.&quot;

&quot;Hayden. This animal?&quot;

&quot;Ah. She is beautiful, Wade.&quot;

&quot;What is she? How would I even train her?&quot;

&quot;She is a unicorn, Wade. A beautiful, beautiful unicorn. She&apos;s very special to me.&quot; You stare at the man, appalled. A unicorn? Those didn&apos;t exist! &quot;Oh Wade, so naive. They do exist. Go find her, Wade. She will take you to a wonderful place. There, you will be able to find something worthy for Elily.&quot; You stare at the man speechlessly  He takes another bite of soup.

&quot;Okay, Hayden. Let&apos;s say I believe you. How would I even tame her?&quot; Hayden became quiet. He turns and his eyes lock with yours. You&apos;re too scared to break the connection.

&quot;She is very special to me, Wade. You cannot speak of her to a single soul. Or anything soulless, for that matter. Understood?&quot; You nod hastily. The tension dissipates and Hayden picks his plate back up. &quot;Just make your way down to the Tack Shop, it&apos;s south of the Appliance Store. Talk to the sales associate there.&quot; You nod, still trying to process what you just learned. You couldn&apos;t make yourself believe that there was actually a unicorn in the forest, but you couldn&apos;t resist looking. &quot;Oh- Wade. You&apos;ll need this.&quot; Hayden hands you a 200CP, and returns to his meal.

You turn west and stumble into a clearing. There&apos;s a small pond and nibbling at the grass around it is a glistening silver unicorn. You move towards the unicorn. She spies you, and whips her head up in alert. You halt instantly, not wanting to scare her away. &quot;Hey, pretty girl,&quot; you say, and reach for a carrot. She watches you intently. You hold the carrot out. &quot;Hey girl, do you want a treat?&quot; She paws at the ground. You take another step forward. Then another. And another. Finally, your outstretched arm holding the carrot is just infront of her head. She reaches forward, and takes the carrot. You give her another.

&quot;A simple potion should do it,&quot; she says slowly.
&quot;Do you have the recipe?&quot; She pulls a wand out from the folds in her clothes and uses it to conjur up a piece of paper and a pen. When she&apos;s finished, she passes you the folded piece of paper.
