You&apos;ve planned a wonderful camping trip with your girlfriend. She&apos;s depending on you to make the experience memorable, but everything keeps going wrong for you.

An Experience
The Beginning by Kapri Lisehora

Campfire
It&apos;s night, but the fire just burned out and you both are getting cold. Your tent is in a grassy clearing. To the north are the woods, to the east a stream, and the west a rocky cliff. A mysterious cabin is to your south. In your tent there&apos;s a cooler, a backpack, and two sleeping bags.

You can see a cooler (closed), a backpack (closed) and sleeping bags here.

You survived the camping trip! However, your girlfriend isn&apos;t very happy with you. You promised her a wonderful weekend, but there was literally nothing wonderful about it. You fed her sketchy soup that you stole from a cabin that you broke into, for heaven&apos;s sake!
But that was last weekend. It&apos;s Saturday morning, and you&apos;re in the Marketplace. You want to make it up to your girl, but you&apos;re not quite sure how. I guess the first thing would be to stop calling her &quot;girl&quot; or &quot;girlfriend&quot;. She has a name. It&apos;s Elily. Now, look around. Maybe you&apos;ll see something to inspire you. (remember, NW, SW, NE and SE are directions)
Marketplace
You are in the center of the Marketplace. Look around to see where you want to go. If you get lost, head over to the General Store for a map.

You turn west and stumble into a clearing. There&apos;s a small pond and nibbling at the grass around it is a glistening silver unicorn. You move towards the unicorn. She spies you, and whips her head up in alert. You halt instantly, not wanting to scare her away. &quot;Hey, pretty girl,&quot; you say, and reach for a carrot. She watches you intently. You hold the carrot out. &quot;Hey girl, do you want a treat?&quot; She paws at the ground. You take another step forward. Then another. And another. Finally, your outstretched arm holding the carrot is just infront of her head. She reaches forward, and takes the carrot. You give her another.

Fifth Trail
You turn west and stumble into a clearing. There&apos;s a small pond and nibbling at the grass around it is a glistening silver unicorn. You move towards the unicorn. She spies you, and whips her head up in alert. You halt instantly, not wanting to scare her away. &quot;Hey, pretty girl,&quot; you say, and reach for a carrot. She watches you intently. You hold the carrot out. &quot;Hey girl, do you want a treat?&quot; She paws at the ground. You take another step forward. Then another. And another. Finally, your outstretched arm holding the carrot is just infront of her head. She reaches forward, and takes the carrot. You give her another.

You can see Unicorn here.

Campfire
It&apos;s night, but the fire just burned out and you both are getting cold. Your tent is in a grassy clearing. To the north are the woods, to the east a stream, and the west a rocky cliff. A mysterious cabin is to your south. In your tent there&apos;s a cooler, a backpack, and two sleeping bags.

Woods
You venture outside towards the woods. You can hear the branches creaking and laughing at your misfortune. Somewhere, an owl hoots a solemn tune before being abruptly cut off. You shiver both from the cold and from the darkness. Tangled in the thorny holly trees are the dead branches of their taller brothers.

It appears to be a small cabin with an outhouse to the east. The windows are boarded up and the oak door looks solid.

Campfire
It&apos;s night, but the fire just burned out and you both are getting cold. Your tent is in a grassy clearing. To the north are the woods, to the east a stream, and the west a rocky cliff. A mysterious cabin is to your south. In your tent there&apos;s a cooler, a backpack, and two sleeping bags.

You can see a cooler (empty) and sleeping bags here.

You survived the camping trip! However, your girlfriend isn&apos;t very happy with you. You promised her a wonderful weekend, but there was literally nothing wonderful about it. You fed her sketchy soup that you stole from a cabin that you broke into, for heaven&apos;s sake!
But that was last weekend. It&apos;s Saturday morning, and you&apos;re in the Marketplace. You want to make it up to your girl, but you&apos;re not quite sure how. I guess the first thing would be to stop calling her &quot;girl&quot; or &quot;girlfriend&quot;. She has a name. It&apos;s Elily. Now, look around. Maybe you&apos;ll see something to inspire you.

The school is small, but you have good memories from it. You can see your computer science teacher, Mr. DK, leaning against the wall, playing on his iPad. He&apos;s known to be a fan of Steve Jobs.

You can see Mr. DK here.

&quot;Hey, Mr. DK,&quot; you say stepping up to him. &quot;I saw this in the store, and I thought you might like it for your classroom, or something.&quot; You hand over the cardboard cutout.

&quot;Oh, thank you, Wade.&quot; Mr. DK says, accepting the cutout. &quot;This really does look like him.&quot; Mr. DK then looks both ways, and leans closer to you. &quot;Now, Wade, I think this guarantees you an A on your project.&quot; You laugh nervously.

&quot;Oh Mr. DK, I&apos;ll still put the work in, but thanks.&quot;

&quot;She is a unicorn, Wade. A beautiful, beautiful unicorn. She&apos;s very special to me.&quot; You stare at the man, appalled. A unicorn? Those didn&apos;t exist! &quot;Oh Wade, so naive. They do exist. Go find her, Wade. She will take you to a wonderful place.

&quot;Okay, Hayden. Let&apos;s say I believe you. How would I even tame her?&quot; Hayden became quiet. He turns and his eyes lock with yours. You&apos;re too scared to break the connection.

&quot;She is very special to me, Wade. You cannot speak of her to a single soul. Or anything soulless, for that matter. Understood?&quot; You nod hastily. The tension dissipates and Hayden picks his plate back up. &quot;Just make your way down to the Tack Shop, it&apos;s south of the Appliance Store. Talk to the sales associate there.&quot; You nod, still trying to process what you just learned. You couldn&apos;t make yourself believe that there was actually a unicorn in the forest, but you couldn&apos;t resist looking. &quot;Oh- Wade. You&apos;ll need this.&quot; Hayden hands you a 200CP, and returns to his meal.

Italian Bistro
The Bistro is the coffee and social hub of the town. Everyone gathers here for a bite to eat, something to drink, or to just talk to the other townspeople. There are menus hanging over the counter, scattered round tables, and a brown sofa.

You can see Mr. Mason and Hayden here.

You turn west and stumble into a clearing. There&apos;s a small pond and nibbling at the grass around it is a glistening silver unicorn. You move towards the unicorn. She spies you, and whips her head up in alert. You halt instantly, not wanting to scare her away. &quot;Hey, pretty girl,&quot; you say, and reach for a carrot. She watches you intently. You hold the carrot out. &quot;Hey girl, do you want a treat?&quot; She paws at the ground. You take another step forward. Then another. And another. Finally, your outstretched arm holding the carrot is just infront of her head. She reaches forward, and takes the carrot. You give her another.

You can see Unicorn here.

&quot;Are you the unicorn?&quot; The bell-like voice chimes a laugh in your head.

&quot;Yea, I am. So, I hear that we have somewhere special to go!&quot;

It&apos;s night, but the fire just burned out and you both are getting cold. Your tent is in a grassy clearing. To the north are the woods, to the east a stream, and the west a rocky cliff. A mysterious cabin is to your south. In your tent there&apos;s a cooler, a backpack, and two sleeping bags.

You can see a cooler (closed), a backpack (closed) and sleeping bags here.
