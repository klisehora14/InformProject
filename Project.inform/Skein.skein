You&apos;ve planned a wonderful camping trip with your girlfriend. She&apos;s depending on you to make the experience memorable, but everything keeps going wrong for you.

An Experience
The Beginning by Kapri Lisehora
Release 1 / Serial number 130312 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Campfire
It&apos;s night, but the fire just burned out and you both are getting cold. Your tent is in a grassy clearing. To the north are the woods, to the east a stream, and the west a rocky cliff. A mysterious cabin is to your south. In your tent there&apos;s a cooler, a backpack, and two sleeping bags.

You can see a cooler (closed), a backpack (closed) and sleeping bags here.

Mer Castle
The castle is gorgeous. The walls reach high and the light orbs float through the water and hang from the ceiling. The floors are made of smooth sandstone and an elegant staircase spirals up to the next floor. There are several doors along either side of you.

&quot;I&apos;m just so interested in your story,&quot; she says. &quot;You&apos;re just like the other land people. How are you down here? How can you breathe water if you&apos;re non-magic?&quot;
&quot;I drank a potion. But I&apos;m not here to talk, I&apos;m sorry. I need to find the portal to get home.&quot; The mermaid grabs a hold of your arm. 
&quot;Don&apos;t leave, landman. Stay here, with me, and tell me of your world. You will be famous, you can write stories, stay here.&quot;
Forget your portal search and stay with her?

&quot;Hayden sent me,&quot; you say cautiously, hoping it will mean something to him. Apparently it does, as he roars in laughter.
&quot;Hayden? The simpleton? Ahaha! What a simple joke!&quot; 
&quot;Or, Hayden just let me know of this place. The blacksmith sent me in this direction,&quot; you say hurridly, trying to fix your mistake.
&quot;There are many blacksmiths, fool. The closest landman who calls himself a blacksmith is just a fool simpleton like your friend Hayden. You are wasting my time, landman.&quot;
&quot;No- wait. Please. I&apos;m not from here. I&apos;m from the non-magic world.&quot; This caught his attention. &quot;My name is Wade, sir. Hayden sent me here to find something but I have no idea what. I&apos;m just trying to find the portal back to my world.&quot;
&quot;There is no portal here!&quot;
&quot;As unfortunate as that is, I&apos;m not surprised. I just wanted to know if you knew anything about the portal, if you could send me on the right track, give me a clue, anything…&quot;

The Mer King studies you quietly for a few minutes. &quot;There is a gate on the path that you must take. It is locked. I have the key.&quot;
&quot;Oh, that&apos;s great!&quot; You are very excited. 
&quot;But I want something of you before I give it. There is a giant ogre who lives in Stone Valley Pass. He often comes to the lake and &quot;frolics&quot; in the water. His weight and stomping destroys the tunnel and our men have to work hard to fix it before we run out of oxygen. He polutes the water and diseases the fish. Bring me proof that you have slain this evil beast, and I shall give you your key.&quot;
The Mer King refuses to talk to you until you bring him proof that you have slain the ogre.

Empty Room
The gate opens up to a large, empty room. The walls are lined with flickering blue fire torches. To the north the shadow of a spiral staircase winds it&apos;s way into the darkness with only the flickering of the magic fire to light the steps. Each footfall echoes.

The castle is gorgeous. The walls reach high and the light orbs float through the water and hang from the ceiling. The floors are made of smooth sandstone and an elegant staircase spirals up to the next floor. There are several doors along either side of you.

&quot;I&apos;m just so interested in your story,&quot; she says. &quot;You&apos;re just like the other land people. How are you down here? How can you breathe water if you&apos;re non-magic?&quot;
&quot;I drank a potion. But I&apos;m not here to talk, I&apos;m sorry. I need to find the portal to get home.&quot; The mermaid grabs a hold of your arm. 
&quot;Don&apos;t leave, landman. Stay here, with me, and tell me of your world. You will be famous, you can write stories, stay here.&quot;

&quot;Hayden sent me,&quot; you say cautiously, hoping it will mean something to him. Apparently it does, as he roars in laughter.

&quot;Or, Hayden just let me know of this place. The blacksmith sent me in this direction,&quot; you say hurridly, trying to fix your mistake.
&quot;There are many blacksmiths, fool. The closest landman who calls himself a blacksmith is just a fool simpleton like your friend Hayden. You are wasting my time, landman.&quot;
&quot;No- wait. Please. I&apos;m not from here. I&apos;m from the non-magic world.&quot; This caught his attention. &quot;My name is Wade, sir. Hayden sent me here to find something but I have no idea what. I&apos;m just trying to find the portal back to my world.&quot;
&quot;There is no portal here!&quot;
&quot;As unfortunate as that is, I&apos;m not surprised. I just wanted to know if you knew anything about the portal, if you could send me on the right track, give me a clue, anything…&quot;

The Mer King studies you quietly for a few minutes. &quot;There is a gate on the path that you must take. It is locked. I have the key.&quot;
&quot;Oh, that&apos;s great!&quot; You are very excited. 
&quot;But I want something of you before I give it. There is a giant ogre who lives in Stone Valley Pass. He often comes to the lake and &quot;frolics&quot; in the water. His weight and stomping destroys the tunnel and our men have to work hard to fix it before we run out of oxygen. He polutes the water and diseases the fish. Bring me proof that you have slain this evil beast, and I shall give you your key.&quot;
The Mer King refuses to talk to you until you bring him proof that you have slain the ogre.

The castle is gorgeous. The walls reach high and the light orbs float through the water and hang from the ceiling. The floors are made of smooth sandstone and an elegant staircase spirals up to the next floor. There are several doors along either side of you.

The sand is still warm from the day and the beach is surprisingly empty. Gentle waves roll under a clear sky that is illuminated by a full moon and peppered with stars.

Campfire
It&apos;s night, but the fire just burned out and you both are getting cold. Your tent is in a grassy clearing. To the north are the woods, to the east a stream, and the west a rocky cliff. A mysterious cabin is to your south. In your tent there&apos;s a cooler, a backpack, and two sleeping bags.

You can see a cooler (closed), a backpack (closed) and sleeping bags here.

&quot;Sir,&quot; she says with a slight curtsey. You help her into the limo, then follow her in. &quot;Where are we going?&quot; She asks, holding onto your arm while looking past you out the window to the lights flashing by.

Outside of the Serata Romantica
The front steps of the Serata Romantica are of marble. A man in a suit opens the limo door for you, escorting Elily out. He uses his other, gloved hand, to guesture up the steps to the north.

Woods
You venture outside towards the woods. You can hear the branches creaking and laughing at your misfortune. Somewhere, an owl hoots a solemn tune before being abruptly cut off. You shiver both from the cold and from the darkness. Tangled in the thorny holly trees are the dead branches of their taller brothers.

&quot;She is a unicorn, Wade. A beautiful, beautiful unicorn. She&apos;s very special to me.&quot; You stare at the man, appalled. A unicorn? Those didn&apos;t exist! &quot;Oh Wade, so naive. They do exist. Go find her, Wade. She will take you to a wonderful place. There, you will be able to find something worthy for Elily.&quot; You stare at the man speechlessly  He takes another bite of curry.

&quot;Okay, Hayden. Let&apos;s say I believe you. How would I even tame her?&quot; Hayden became quiet. He turns and his eyes lock with yours. You&apos;re too scared to break the connection.

&quot;She is very special to me, Wade. You cannot speak of her to a single soul. Or anything soulless, for that matter. Understood?&quot; You nod hastily. The tension dissipates and Hayden picks his plate back up. &quot;Just make your way down to the Tack Shop, it&apos;s south of the Appliance Store. Talk to the sales associate there.&quot; You nod, still trying to process what you just learned. You couldn&apos;t make yourself believe that there was actually a unicorn in the forest, but you couldn&apos;t resist looking. &quot;Oh- Wade. You&apos;ll need this.&quot; Hayden hands you a 200CP, and returns to his meal.

&quot;Yeah, how specific.&quot;

&quot;Pardon?&quot;

&quot;Nothing. Here, let me just go grab some.&quot; She marches off in a huff, leaving you standing next to horse mannequins and a mini-fridge of carrots.

She returns with a simple black leather bridal over her shoulder and a saddle on her hip. &quot;This work for you, kid?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I suppose.&quot; She rings them up. &quot;I&apos;m going to give you these carrots for free, too. That&apos;ll be 200CP.&quot;

A lovely little park. It has a few tall trees and a picnic bench. It looks like someone abandoned their picnic here.

You have no idea where the unicorn could be, and the trails are all a maze. You better start looking.

You hold the carrot out. &quot;Hey girl, do you want a treat?&quot; She paws at the ground. You take another step forward. Then another. And another. Finally, your outstretched arm holding the carrot is just infront of her head. She reaches forward, and takes the carrot. You give her another.

&quot;Are you the unicorn?&quot; The bell-like voice chimes a laugh in your head.

&quot;Yea, I am. So, I hear that we have somewhere special to go!&quot;
Amara picks up a trot, and heads north. At about fifty yards away from the trees she hastens her pace, and leaps into the air. You clutch desperately at her soft white mane in an effort to stay on.

You look behind you as she climbs ever higher. You can see the town. A man in a black coat stands in the center of the marketplace, and seems to be watching you. But a blink later and he&apos;s gone. &quot;Where are we going, Amara?&quot;

&quot;Oh, you&apos;ll see.&quot;

Broken Lighthouse
A cliff drops off towards the ocean, with a tall lighthouse looming over. The ocean is dark blue and frothy from slamming against the sharp rocks at the base of the cliff. To the north is an old, unkept cobblestone path.

You&apos;ve planned a wonderful camping trip with your girlfriend. She&apos;s depending on you to make the experience memorable, but everything keeps going wrong for you.

An Experience
The Beginning by Kapri Lisehora
Release 1 / Serial number 130302 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Campfire
It&apos;s night, but the fire just burned out and you both are getting cold. Your tent is in a grassy clearing. To the north are the woods, to the east a stream, and the west a rocky cliff. A mysterious cabin is to your south. In your tent there&apos;s a cooler, a backpack, and two sleeping bags.

You can see a cooler (closed), a backpack (closed) and sleeping bags here.

The best kept store in town. The inside looks like a library, except instead of books stacked to the ceiling there are long slender boxes. Along the door are buckets of spellbooks.

A wand is what you surely need.&quot; You just nod and go long with it. The wizard starts muttering to himself, making circles around you. &quot;Yes, yes, a tall young boy…brown hair, too, yes…perhaps mahagony?…no, no, thating circles around you. &apos;s not it.&quot; The man skuttles off leaving you alone for several minutes.

Bearing a long slender box, the man hurries back to you. He runs awkwardly; as if his legs are half as long as they should be. &quot;Here, here, me&apos;boy. Try this one. It&apos;s perfect, it is.&quot; He opens the box, extending it to you. Reaching in, you pick up the long slender piece of wood. It&apos;s nicely polished if nothing else. The wizard watches, expectant.
&quot;Well? What do you have to give me for it?&quot; You reach into your pockets and pull out the unicorn hair that ripped out in your hands from the ride. His eyes widen. &quot;Perfect, perfect. This is perfect.&quot; He snatches the hair from you and skuttles back into the depths of his shop.

&quot;What?. I used to live down south where the normal people live. I used to go to restaurants and buy flowers for all the girls in my life. I used to be a real charmer, you know. But I met a man named Hayden. That must have been fifty years ago. Amara brought me here.&quot;
&quot;Well, that all sounds familiar.&quot;
&quot;Hayden sent me here for a personal quest of my own, but I was just overtaken by this land, boy. This world is beyond your most glorious imaginations. Sure, it snows ninety perfect of the time, but the air smells of magic and I fell in love. I&apos;m warning you now, boy. This world will steal your heart away. If you truly want to go home, then you must find your way. But if you decide to stay, I could help you along.&quot; You look at the man, and think of Elily. You had to return to her. Right? 
&quot;Mr. Blacksmith,&quot; you say. &quot;How might I find my way out of here?&quot;
 The man sighs. &quot;There&apos;s a dirt path behind my shop that leads north to the mountains. I&apos;ve heard tale of a magic portal up there. I&apos;m sure that could get you back home.&quot;

&quot;Wait, kid. Look, it gets dangerous up there. Go to the armory and pick up some weapons.&quot;
