You&apos;ve planned a wonderful camping trip with your girlfriend. She&apos;s depending on you to make the experience memorable, but everything keeps going wrong for you.

An Experience
The Beginning by Kapri Lisehora
Release 1 / Serial number 130308 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Campfire
It&apos;s night, but the fire just burned out and you both are getting cold. Your tent is in a grassy clearing. To the north are the woods, to the east a stream, and the west a rocky cliff. A mysterious cabin is to your south. In your tent there&apos;s a cooler, a backpack, and two sleeping bags.

You can see a cooler (closed), a backpack (closed) and sleeping bags here.

&quot;Sir,&quot; she says with a slight curtsey. You help her into the limo, then follow her in. &quot;Where are we going?&quot; She asks, holding onto your arm while looking past you out the window to the lights flashing by.
&quot;Oh, you&apos;ll see.&quot;

Outside of the Serata Romantica
The front steps of the Serata Romantica are of marble. A man in a suit opens the limo door for you, escorting Elily out. He uses his other, gloved hand, to guesture up the steps to the north.

Campfire
It&apos;s night, but the fire just burned out and you both are getting cold. Your tent is in a grassy clearing. To the north are the woods, to the east a stream, and the west a rocky cliff. A mysterious cabin is to your south. In your tent there&apos;s a cooler, a backpack, and two sleeping bags.

You can see a cooler (closed), a backpack (closed) and sleeping bags here.

The front steps of the Serata Romantica are of marble. A man in a suit opens the limo door for you, escorting Elily out. He uses his other, gloved hand, to guesture up the steps to the north.

Mer City
Mer City is beautiful. Mermen and merwomen swim around town as normal as if they were people on land. Each home has a small garden of kelp. The castle gate is north, and the castle lays just behind it.

&quot;I&apos;m just so interested in your story,&quot; she says. &quot;You&apos;re just like the other land people. How are you down here? How can you breathe water if you&apos;re non-magic?&quot;
&quot;I drank a potion. But I&apos;m not here to talk, I&apos;m sorry. I need to find the portal to get home.&quot; The mermaid grabs a hold of your arm.

His weight and stomping destroys the tunnel and our men have to work hard to fix it before we run out of oxygen. He polutes the water and diseases the fish. Bring me proof that you have slain this evil beast, and I shall give you your key.&quot;
The Mer King refuses to talk to you until you bring him proof that you have slain the ogre.

Mer Castle
The castle is gorgeous. The walls reach high and the light orbs float through the water and hang from the ceiling. The floors are made of smooth sandstone and an elegant staircase spirals up to the next floor. There are several doors along either side of you.

Mermaids are swimming around carelessly and small homes are settled on the floor of the lake, completely sumberged in a giant underwater cave. Glowing orbs line the streets, fill the homes, and adorn the cave walls, bringing a bright but artificial light to the city. A beautiful sandstone castle lays due north.

Mer City
Mer City is beautiful. Mermen and merwomen swim around town as normal as if they were people on land. Each home has a small garden of kelp. The castle gate is north, and the castle lays just behind it.

You survived the camping trip! However, your girlfriend isn&apos;t very happy with you. You promised her a wonderful weekend, but there was literally nothing wonderful about it. You fed her sketchy soup that you stole from a cabin that you broke into, for heaven&apos;s sake!
But that was last weekend. It&apos;s Saturday morning, and you&apos;re in the Marketplace. You want to make it up to your girl, but you&apos;re not quite sure how. I guess the first thing would be to stop calling her &quot;girl&quot; or &quot;girlfriend&quot;. She has a name. It&apos;s Elily. Now, look around. Maybe you&apos;ll see something to inspire you. (remember, NW, SW, NE and SE are directions)

School
The school is small, but you have good memories from it. You can see your computer science teacher, Mr. DK, leaning against the wall, playing on his iPad. He&apos;s known to be a fan of Steve Jobs.

You can see Mr. DK here.

&quot;Oh, thank you, Wade.&quot; Mr. DK says, accepting the cutout. &quot;This really does look like him.&quot; Mr. DK then looks both ways, and leans closer to you. &quot;Now, Wade, I think this guarantees you an A on your project.&quot; You laugh nervously.

&quot;She is very special to me, Wade. You cannot speak of her to a single soul. Or anything soulless, for that matter. Understood?&quot; You nod hastily.

Park
A lovely little park. It has a few tall trees and a picnic bench. It looks like someone abandoned their picnic here.

You have no idea where the unicorn could be, and the trails are all a maze. You better start looking.

Forest
The forest is criss-crossed with hiking and biking trails. It&apos;s a nice place to go for a walk.

You turn west and stumble into a clearing. There&apos;s a small pond and nibbling at the grass around it is a glistening silver unicorn. You move towards the unicorn. She spies you, and whips her head up in alert. You halt instantly, not wanting to scare her away. &quot;Hey, pretty girl,&quot; you say, and reach for a carrot. She watches you intently. You hold the carrot out. &quot;Hey girl, do you want a treat?&quot; She paws at the ground. You take another step forward. Then another. And another. Finally, your outstretched arm holding the carrot is just infront of her head. She reaches forward, and takes the carrot. You give her another.

You can see Unicorn here.

&quot;Hayden said you were coming,&quot; says a bell-like voice in your head. You nearly fall off the unicorn. &quot;You&apos;re so silly,&quot; the voice continues. &quot;My name is Amara.&quot; You look down at your mount.

&quot;Are you the unicorn?&quot; The bell-like voice chimes a laugh in your head.

&quot;Yea, I am. So, I hear that we have somewhere special to go!&quot;
Amara picks up a trot, and heads north. At about fifty yards away from the trees she hastens her pace, and leaps into the air. You clutch desperately at her soft white mane in an effort to stay on.

You look behind you as she climbs ever higher. You can see the town. A man in a black coat stands in the center of the marketplace, and seems to be watching you. But a blink later and he&apos;s gone. &quot;Where are we going, Amara?&quot;

&quot;Oh, you&apos;ll see.&quot;

Broken Lighthouse
A cliff drops off towards the ocean, with a tall lighthouse looming over. The ocean is dark blue and frothy from slamming against the sharp rocks at the base of the cliff. To the north is an old, unkept cobblestone path.

But you aren&apos;t in anything at the moment.

Campfire
It&apos;s night, but the fire just burned out and you both are getting cold. Your tent is in a grassy clearing. To the north are the woods, to the east a stream, and the west a rocky cliff. A mysterious cabin is to your south. In your tent there&apos;s a cooler, a backpack, and two sleeping bags.

You can see a cooler (closed), a backpack (closed) and sleeping bags here.

&quot;Obviously.&quot; He becons you in, and steps aside. You enter one giant room with a door to the north and a door to the east, which seems to lead to his private quarters. &quot;Did a unicorn bring you?&quot; You nod, amazed that you&apos;re still finding things suprising today.

&quot;Wade.&quot;
&quot;What?. I used to live down south where the normal people live. I used to go to restaurants and buy flowers for all the girls in my life. I used to be a real charmer, you know. But I met a man named Hayden. That must have been fifty years ago. Amara brought me here.&quot;
&quot;Well, that all sounds familiar.&quot;
&quot;Hayden sent me here for a personal quest of my own, but I was just overtaken by this land, boy. This world is beyond your most glorious imaginations. Sure, it snows ninety perfect of the time, but the air smells of magic and I fell in love. I&apos;m warning you now, boy. This world will steal your heart away. If you truly want to go home, then you must find your way. But if you decide to stay, I could help you along.&quot; You look at the man, and think of Elily. You had to return to her. Right? 
&quot;Mr. Blacksmith,&quot; you say. &quot;How might I find my way out of here?&quot;
 The man sighs. &quot;There&apos;s a dirt path behind my shop that leads north to the mountains. I&apos;ve heard tale of a magic portal up there. I&apos;m sure that could get you back home.&quot;

&quot;Wait, kid. Look, it gets dangerous up there. Go to the armory and pick up some weapons.&quot;

&quot;How am I supposed to get down there?&quot;
&quot;A simple potion should do it,&quot; she says slowly.
&quot;Do you have the recipe?&quot; She pulls a wand out from the folds in her clothes and uses it to conjur up a piece of paper and a pen. When she&apos;s finished, she passes you the folded piece of paper.

    <result xml:space="preserve">You enter a city and are speachless. Mermaids are swimming around carelessly and small homes are settled on the floor of the lake, completely sumberged in a giant underwater cave. Glowing orbs line the streets, fill the homes, and adorn the cave walls, bringing a bright but artificial light to the city. A beautiful sandstone castle lays due north.

Mer City
Mer City is beautiful. Mermen and merwomen swim around town as normal as if they were people on land. Each home has a small garden of kelp. The castle gate is north, and the castle lays just behind it.

The gate to Mer Castle is merely for show, as any creature could swim over the walls. Two guards draped in armor and holding spears are blocking the gate.
